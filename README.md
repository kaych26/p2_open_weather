SWOT Analysis
---------------------
After connecting the API and retrieving the data, I am comfortable that this is a stable API and able to use the data. I amy encounter issues doing the following:

 - Creating the storybook component and using it in the react app. If running into issue, I will try to use google and online videos.

 - I will take this opportunity to get more familiar with grid styling for the detail page with the sidebar layout.

 - If time allows, I will try to build the hamburger menu tab which I will try to figure it out.
